Flash Card App

An app that allows you to create decks of flash cards. Each card is composed of required title and 
description, and optional audio and image. There will be an additional quiz mode, where the app will
randomly pull cards from a deck, omit details and ask a question with multiple choice answers. 
Eventually, I'd like the app to also track performance, pushing harder cards to the front. The 
'wrong' multiple choice options should be from a minimum list of default answers, where new cards 
are added as they are created. This makes it so that different multiple choice answers are coming 
from the other cards, but still provides something if there are too few cards to fetch answers.
